## Project Goals

Do you like yummy food? Do you like to share your food with foodies?

and share your food with people who also love yummy food all around the world.


## APIs & Data Involved

This website connects to three APIs: 
TheMealDB API for food recipes 
([https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun)),
TheCocktailDB for drink recipes 
([https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun)),
the IBM text-to-speech API for transferring text to speech
([https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/text-to-speech?code=python](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/text-to-speech?code=python)).

**Please Note**: Both TheMealDB and TheCocktailDB APIs are free.
The IBM text-to-speech API has free 10,000 Characters per Month.
We just transfer the names of food or drink to speech.

In addition, we have used the BeautifulSoup to grab the food nutrition data
